# Automated-News-Categorization-Using-Data-Science-Techniques

**Project Title**
_"Automated News Categorization and Analysis Using Machine Learning"_

**Problem Statement**
With the exponential growth of online news content, manually categorizing and analyzing news articles is time-consuming and inefficient. Dawn's website publishes a variety of news articles daily, making it challenging for users to access information organized by their interests or categories. This project aims to automate the process of categorizing news articles into predefined categories using machine learning models and web scraping techniques. The proposed solution will provide accurate and organized news data, enhancing user experience and enabling efficient data analysis for trends and insights.

**Business Questions:**
1. Which category has the most news articles?
2. Which category generated the highest number of articles on [specific date]?
3. What is the percentage distribution of each news category?
4. How many articles were published in the technology category on its busiest day?
5. What is the peak publication date for the health category, and how many articles were published?"
6. What percentage of news articles relate directly to business and financial markets?
7. Are there noticeable trends in news frequency over time?
8. What are the top-performing categories in terms of engagement (e.g., popularity or readership)?
9. Which category had the fewest articles published on?
10. What are the most common topics or themes across all categories?
