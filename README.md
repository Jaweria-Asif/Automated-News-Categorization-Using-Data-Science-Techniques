# Automated-News-Categorization-Using-Data-Science-Techniques
**Project Title**
"Automated News Categorization and Analysis Using Machine Learning"

**Problem Statement**
With the exponential growth of online news content, manually categorizing and analyzing news articles is time-consuming and inefficient. Dawn's website publishes a variety of news articles daily, making it challenging for users to access information organized by their interests or categories. This project aims to automate the process of categorizing news articles into predefined categories using machine learning models and web scraping techniques. The proposed solution will provide accurate and organized news data, enhancing user experience and enabling efficient data analysis for trends and insights.

**Business Questions**
1- How can we efficiently scrape the latest news articles from Dawn's website and organize them into structured data?
2- What are the most effective keywords and techniques for accurately classifying news articles into predefined categories?
3- Which machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) perform best for text classification in this context?
4- How does combining model predictions using a voting classifier improve classification accuracy?
5- What trends or patterns can be observed in the categorized news articles over time?
6- How can this categorized data be used to improve user experience or provide actionable insights for businesses or policymakers?
